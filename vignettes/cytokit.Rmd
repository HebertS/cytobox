Load the package

```{r load}
library(cytokit)
```

Plot a t-SNE coloured by mean marker expression

```{r tsneByMeanMarkerExpression, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

tsneByMeanMarkerExpression(pbmc, c("IL32", "CD2"))

```


Plot a t-SNE coloured by percentiles marker expression

```{r tsneByPercentilesMarkerExpression, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}

tsneByPercentileMarkerExpression(pbmc, c("IL32", "CD2"))

```

Pariwise violin plot

```{r markerViolinPlot, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}

markerViolinPlot(pbmc, markers_pbmc, pbmc, "PBMC1", "PBMC2", "res.1", "res.1")

```


Heatmap of minimum % overlap of gene markers between clusters from two different samples:
(here, comparing one dataset to itself)

```{r heatmapPercentMarkerOverlap, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4}

heatmapPercentMarkerOverlap(markers_pbmc, markers_pbmc, s1_name = "PBMC", s2_name = "PBMC")

```
